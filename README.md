# PictureViewerVisualBasic
Image viewer made with Visual Basic. Heavily inspired by a Microsoft tutorial, however it includes two extra features.

# Music Player
It will play .wav audio files during your image viewing for maximum entertainment.

# Can do "Open with", or use as main Viewer
Perfect if you somehow got rid of your UWP image viewer (it sucks anyways).

# How to compile
I was lazy so I only uploaded the one vb file containing the code. All you have to do is to design the window yourself and make sure the names of the items are correct.
